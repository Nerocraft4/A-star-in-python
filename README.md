# A* search algorithm in Python
Implementation of the A* algorithm in Python. This particular case works with Barcelona's and Lyon's public transportation system, combined with walking distances. It calculates optimal routes between points, choosing metro lanes and exchanging between them if needed.

Any tests can be executed from Code/demo.py, where there are commented snippets of code.
